    "That is a fantastic effort\\! As a \"teacher,\" I am very impressed that you are using **`pathlib`** instead of the older `os.path` module. That shows you are learning modern, industry-standard Python practices. You also broke your code into functions, which is the hallmark of a good software engineer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, even the best code can be improved. I have analyzed your code and prepared a guide on how to take it from \"Student Level\" to \"Professional Developer Level.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1\\. The Code Audit: What can be improved?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the specific areas we will focus on to improve your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself):** You have three different functions (`coppy_file_with_extention`, `coppy_file_without_extention`, `coppy_folder`) that do almost the same thing. In programming, if you write the same logic twice, you should probably merge them.\n",
    "  * **Spelling & Naming:** In professional teams, spelling matters because other people need to read your code.\n",
    "      * *Correction:* `extention` → `extension`\n",
    "      * *Correction:* `coppy` → `copy`\n",
    "  * **Logic Simplification:**\n",
    "      * You are using `split('.')[1]` to get extensions. This is risky because some files have multiple dots (e.g., `archive.tar.gz`) or no dots at all. `pathlib` has a built-in `.suffix` property that is safer.\n",
    "      * You are building a `dir_list` to avoid infinite loops (copying the copied files). This is smart\\! However, we can do this even more cleanly by checking paths.\n",
    "  * **Error Handling:** You have `try...except` blocks inside every small function. While safe, it makes the code \"noisy.\" usually, we handle errors at a higher level or use specific checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2\\. The Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I show you the fixed code, look at this visualization of what we are trying to achieve to ensure the logic is sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this efficiently, we will use these \"Best Practices\":\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`pathlib.Path.suffix`:** Instead of splitting strings, we ask the path object for its suffix.\n",
    "2.  **`shutil.move` vs `shutil.copy2`:** Usually, when organizing files, we *move* them (cut/paste) rather than copy them (copy/paste), so we don't end up with duplicate files taking up hard drive space. However, I will keep your logic of **copying** for safety, but I will simplify the function.\n",
    "3.  **F-Strings:** We will use f-strings (e.g., `f\"Success: {filename}\"`) for cleaner printing.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3\\. The Refactored \"Pro\" Code\n",

    "### 4\\. Key Lessons from the Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Handling Extensions the Pythonic Way**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Your way:** `get_extention.split(\".\")[1]`\n",
    "  * **My way:** `item.suffix.lower().lstrip('.')`\n",
    "      * `item.suffix`: Gets the extension automatically (e.g., `.JPG`).\n",
    "      * `.lower()`: Makes `.JPG` and `.jpg` go into the same folder (very important for Windows users\\!).\n",
    "      * `.lstrip('.')`: Removes the dot nicely.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Boolean Logic for \"Other\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * I used this trick: `extension = item.suffix ... or \"Other\"`.\n",
    "  * In Python, empty strings evaluate to `False`. So if a file has no extension, the code automatically picks \"Other\". This removed an entire `if/else` block from your code\\!\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * At the bottom, I added this check. This is a best practice. It prevents your `main()` function from running automatically if you try to import this script into another program later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Challenge for You (Next Step)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your current code **copies** files. If you run this on a folder with 50GB of movies, you will suddenly use 100GB of space (50GB original + 50GB copied).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can you modify the `copy_item` function to use `shutil.move` instead?**\n",
    "*Hint: If you move files, you don't need to create a `dir_list` to avoid infinite loops, because the source file disappears after it is moved\\!*"
